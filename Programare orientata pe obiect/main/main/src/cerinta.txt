4. CAR RENTAL
Cristina works at the Wheels Inc. car rental company. Wheels Inc. has a car pool
available for renting. Each car has a unique license number, a model and a category (one
of small, family, SUV, sports). Cristina would like to have a computer program to help
her better manage the car rental process in the following ways:

a. Whenever a new car is added to the car pool she must be able to add it to the program's car list.
b. She wants to be able to update the model and category for any car in the car pool.
c. She wants to be able to remove cars from the car pool.
d. She wants to be able to quickly consult the list of:
	i. The cars in the car pool
	ii. Cars that are currently rented
	iii. Cars available for rental
	
e. She wants the program to help her with car renting. She can mark any available car as rented (so
   it cannot be rented again) and any rented car as available (so it can again be rented).
